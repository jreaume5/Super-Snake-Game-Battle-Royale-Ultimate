# Super-Snake-Game-Battle-Royale-Ultimate
Super Snake Game Battle Royale Ultimate is a spin on the classic snake game that integrates battle royale elements to
reshape the playing field. Unlike the original version of the game, SSGBRU aims to support up to 4 snakes
competing in the same arena to be the last one standing. Fans of the traditional game will appreciate
how familiar the gameplay is while also being introduced to entirely new mechanics. SSGBRU's methodology
includes using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to train the AI agent snakes to develop their own
unique playstyles, specifically rewarding the bots for the longer they survive, eating food, and avoiding obstacles.
