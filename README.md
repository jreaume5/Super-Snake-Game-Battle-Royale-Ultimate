# Super-Snake-Game-Battle-Royale-Ultimate
Super Snake Game Battle Royale Ultimate is a spin on the classic snake game that integrates battle royale elements to
reshape the playing field. Unlike the original version of the game, SSGBRU aims to support up to 4 snakes
competing in the same arena to be the last one standing. Fans of the traditional game will appreciate
how familiar the gameplay is while also being introduced to entirely new mechanics. SSGBRU's methodology
includes using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to train the AI agent snakes to develop their own
unique playstyles, specifically rewarding the bots for the longer they survive, eating food, killing other
snakes, and avoiding obstacles.

The game will have several modes: 
- Regular single player snake game
- 1v1 local snake game battle royale
- Single player vs neural networks battle royale
- Simulation mode
  - Players will be able to control different aspects of the game and observe how up to 4 AI agent snakes respond.
